# How to Prepare Your Own Dataset for (Re-)Training model using Tensorflow
Once you have sampled images and are willing to improve your model, you will need to prepare new dataset to re-train the model. This document guides you how to prepare dataset used in Tensorflow.

## Things that will be covered...
* Organize sampled images
* Annotate images
* Convert annotated images into TFRecord (from Tensorflow)
* Get TFRecord ready for (re-)training tensorflow model
