# Caffe installation instructions for Odroid XU4

(Please note that this document details how to install the CPU-only version of Caffe.
Caffe is built on the CUDA library, which allows for GPU processing on NVIDIA GPUs only.
Because the XU4 is equipped with a Mali GPU, it is not CUDA compatible and is not able to perform GPU processing.)


1). Install the general dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends ddlibboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev
```

After performing these steps, reboot your odroid with sudo reboot

2). Download Caffe Source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
cd caffe
cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
```

3). Make the following changes to Makefile.config:

(Note: The directories specified in this section may be different than the ones you have on your system.)

1. Ensure that the line “CPU_ONLY := 1” (Line 8) is UNcommented.
2. Ensure that the paths variables of various python files are correct.

PYTHON_INCLUDE and PYTHON_LIB will need to point to Python.h, numpy/arrayobject.h, and libPythonX.X.so (Lines 64/65 and 79).
Verify that the following files exist in their respective directories before proceeding.

python.h ==> /usr/include/python2.7     
numpy/arrayobject.h ==> /usr/include/python2.7/numpy
libpython2.7.so ==> /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf

3). Build Caffe (This step could take about an hour):

CMake (Usually works better):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make all
make install
make runtest
```

Make:

```
make all -j8
make test -j8
make runtest
```

(If errors are encountered, you may have forgotten to install a particular library or dependency. Download the needed files, then make clean and start the make process again.)

4). Enable Caffe in Python:

```
make pycaffe
sudo apt-get install python-skimage python-protobuf python-pydot python-pandas
cd caffe/python
python
import caffe
```

If no errors are returned, the install was successful! Otherwise, you may need to go back and install a required dependency.
