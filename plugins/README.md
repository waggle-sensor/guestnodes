# Node Stack - Plugins

This is a collection of plugins which we deploy to the nodes.

Note: We currently maintain an old plugin pipeline and are developing a new pipeline. Until we transition fully to the new pipeline, we're marking new style plugins with a `.plugin` extension and older ones without it.
