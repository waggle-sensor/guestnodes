# Node Stack - Plugin Manager

This is currently undergoing significant redevelopment and will change in the future. Currently, this repo is
primiarily a collection of plugins which we deploy to the nodes, but manage via systemd.

Example plugins can be found under the [plugins](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/plugin_manager/tree/master/plugins) directory.

## Setup

Installation of some common plugin dependencies can be done by running:

```sh
./configure
```
